### Question 1A: Complete the final two columns of the life table.  

|Age, $i$| Fecundity, $b_{i}$  | Number observed $n_{i}$ | Yearly survival, $s_{i}$ | Cumulative survival, $l_{i}$|
|:----:|:----:|:---------:|:---------:|:---------:|
|0|0.6|50|0.3| 1 |
|1|1.5|15|0  |0.3|
|2|0  |0 |-  |0  |

### Question 1B: Compute $R_{0}$ for this population. Do you expect it to grow or shrink over time? 
The basic reproductive rate $R_{0}$ can be calculated as
$$\sum_{n=1}^{i} l_{i}b_{i} = (1*0.6)+(0.3*1.5) = 1.05$$  
This means that each new offspring is expected to leave behind, on average, 1.05 offsprings of its own- so the population is expected to grow.

### Question 1C: Draw the life cycle graph for this population. How many age classes are needed?

### Question 1D: Write down the Leslie matrix that describes the dynamics of the system.  
$$\mathbf{L} = \left[\begin{array}
{rr}
0.6 & 1.5 \\
0.3 & 0
\end{array}\right]
$$

### Question 1E: Calculate the eigenvalues for this matrix by hand. Find the stable age distribution. 

### Question 1E: Calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors for this matrix with `R`.

```{r}
ll <- matrix(c(0.6, 1.5, 0.3, 0  ), byrow = T, ncol = 2); ll

ll_eigen <- eigen(ll)

# Take a look at the eigenvalues
ll_eigen$values

# Normalize the first eigenvector to get stable age distrib
sad <- ll_eigen$vectors[,1]/(sum(ll_eigen$vectors[,1])); sad
```

### Question 1G: Confirm the result in part F by showing that the dominant eigenvector and eigenvalue satisfy the eigenvalue equation $L\bar{v}_{i} = \lambda_{i}\bar{v}_{i}$
